## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project enhanced my understanding of many CSS fundamentals and advanced functionalities. From variables, flex, grids to media queries and active states - this challenge tests them all.

### Continued development

The curved sections used in the webpage are made up of images and background colors. Since I couldn't figure out a way to employ `background-images` in CSS without breaking the layout or redefining the work I had accomplished, I used those assets as full-width images within the HTML itself. That is something I'd like to touch upon in future projects.
